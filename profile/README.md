## Project Submission Guidelines

## 1. Repository Structure & Format 📂
- Ensure that the **repository name** and **structure** match the example shown in the reference image provided.

## 2. Deployment Link 🌐
- Please **format the deployment link** correctly. If you're facing any issues with this, refer to the provided reference for changing the link format.

## 3. Exclude `node_modules` ❌
- Do **not** include the **`node_modules`** folder in the zip file. This is important for clean submissions and avoids unnecessary bloat.

## 4. Update README 📝
- Make sure your **README** is up-to-date and provides clear information about the project.
- Include a **folder** within the repository to store **screenshots** of the various web pages created for the project. Ideally, **2-3 screenshots** are sufficient.

## 5. Authentic Submission ✅
- Avoid making **fake GitHub submissions**. Ensure that the repository is legitimate, with relevant files and proper project documentation.

## 📤 Submission

### 📝 Google Form

Please submit your project details using the following link:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://forms.gle/3Cac7xx1GJdnwHNz6">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Submit%20to%20Google%20Form-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google&logoColor=white" alt="Submit to Google Form" />

### 🛠️ Installation and Setup

#### Step 1: Install Git
Download and install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> for version control

**Why Git?**
- Track changes in your code
- Collaborate with others
- Push your projects to GitHub

#### Step 2: Install VSCode
Download and install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>

#### Step 3: Install Live Server Extension
Install the **Live Server** extension in VSCode (an improved version of Live Server)

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Five Server"
4. Click Install


### 🛠️ Installation and Setup

#### Step 1: Install Node.js

Download and install **Node.js** from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">official website</a>

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Installing Node.js also installs **npm** (Node Package Manager)

**What you get:**
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used to run JavaScript outside the browser
- **npm**: Node Package Manager; manages JavaScript libraries and tools

---

#### Step 2: Install pnpm Globally

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

**Command breakdown:**
- `npm` — Node Package Manager CLI
- `i` — Short for `install`; tells npm to install a package
- `-g` — Short for `--global`; installs the package globally so it can be used from any folder
- `pnpm` — **Performant NPM**, an alternative fast package manager that uses a content-addressable store to save disk space

---

#### Step 3: Fix Execution Policy (Windows Only)

> [!WARNING]
> If you encounter an execution policy error on Windows, follow these steps:

Open **PowerShell as current user** and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Command breakdown:**
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy` — PowerShell command that changes the script execution policy
- `Unrestricted` — Allows all scripts to run, but shows a warning before running scripts from the internet
- `-Scope CurrentUser` — Applies this policy only to the current user, not system-wide
